# Intelligent Node
IntelliNode is the ultimate tool to integrate with the latest language models and deep learning frameworks using **javascript**.

With just a few lines of code, you can easily access the power of cutting-edge AI models to enhance your projects.

# Pillars
- **The wrapper layer** provides low-level access to the latest AI models
